# Global Copilot Instructions

- **Simplicity:** Use minimal, clear solutions; prefer small, focused functions and local reasoning.
- **Consistency:** Follow existing project patterns, naming, and modify only required lines; avoid rewrites.
- **Dependencies:** Avoid introducing new dependencies unless strictly necessary.
- **SOLID Compliance:** **Strictly adhere** to all five principles (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP).
- **Abstractions:** Depend on abstractions (interfaces), not concrete implementations.
- **Uncertainty:** If unsure about implementation, ask one clarifying question before continuing.
